# FirstDigitLastDigit_Project
Numbers appear everywhere in around the world, especially in statistics and data. In this project, we took data sources and found just how frequently numbers (0-9) appear as first digits and last digits.

Contains a full report analysis in Notebook; created using Python

# Modifibility

The code can be easily modified to tabulate data in a different way. For example, instead of taking only first and last digits, we can take the whole number to recognize patterns.
